# @tradecanvas/commons

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- d904d59: feat: Fisher Transform, Detrended Price Oscillator, and Balance of Power indicators

  - `fisher` — Fisher Transform (John Ehlers): Gaussian-normalizes price so
    turning points appear as sharp peaks, plotted with a one-bar lagged trigger
    line (the log singularity is clamped). Zero-centered.
  - `dpo` — Detrended Price Oscillator: removes the longer trend
    (`close[i − period/2 − 1] − SMA(close, period)`) to expose price cycles.
  - `bop` — Balance of Power: per-bar buyer/seller strength
    `(close − open)/(high − low)`, SMA-smoothed, bounded to [−1, 1].

  All three registered in the indicator menu and unit-tested.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- f3072ed: feat: more indicators — Know Sure Thing, Elder Ray, Schaff Trend Cycle, Klinger Oscillator, Williams Alligator

  Know Sure Thing (KST)

  - New `kst` panel indicator (Martin Pring) — a momentum oscillator from four
    smoothed rates of change weighted 1:2:3:4 toward the longer cycles, plus an
    SMA signal line. KST crossing its signal (and the zero line) flags momentum
    shifts. Zero-centered, auto-scaled, fully configurable ROC/SMA/signal periods.
    Registered in the indicator menu; tested.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- a2279b6: feat: indicator expansion — Vortex, Choppiness, Ultimate Oscillator, Force Index, Connors RSI, Coppock, Chandelier Exit, Session VWAP bands

  Vortex Indicator (VI+ / VI−)

  - New `vortex` panel indicator plots VI+ and VI− from consecutive highs/lows
    normalised by true range (configurable `period`, default 14). VI+ crossing
    above VI− signals an up-trend (and vice-versa); a 1.0 reference line marks the
    pivot. Auto-scales to the visible range. Registered in the indicator menu;
    tested.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- d7d777f: feat: draggable bracket order entry

  - **Place an entry + stop-loss + take-profit bracket by dragging.**
    `chart.startBracket('buy' | 'sell', entry?)` opens a live preview — an entry
    line plus shaded red (risk) and green (reward) zones with price and R:R
    labels. Drag any of the three lines to retune (entry translates the whole
    bracket; SL/TP clamp to the correct side). Confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd> /
    `confirmBracket()`, cancel with <kbd>Esc</kbd> / `cancelBracket()`.
  - Emits a single typed **`bracketPlace`** event
    (`{ side, entry, stopLoss, takeProfit, riskReward }`) — the chart never places
    orders itself, matching the host-owned trading model.
  - Widget: green/red **Long/Short toolbar buttons** start a bracket at the
    latest price; a floating **Place / Cancel** bar appears while placing.
  - Core: new `BracketTool` with pure, tested helpers (`computeBracketDefaults`,
    `bracketRiskReward`) housed in the `TradingManager` pointer/render pipeline;
    `InteractionManager` gains an Enter-to-confirm hook.

### Patch Changes

- 6646fa0: feat: price alerts UI panel

  - **Bell button + floating alerts panel** in `ChartWidget` — add, list, and
    delete price alerts from the toolbar without touching the API. The add form
    prefills the current price and offers all five conditions (crossing,
    crossing up/down, greater/less than) plus an optional note. Triggered alerts
    surface a toast and are flagged in the list. Default on; opt out with
    `alerts: false`. Bottom-sheet on phones (< 640 px).
  - **Proper alert events** — the chart now emits typed `alertAdd`,
    `alertRemove`, and `alertTriggered` events (with an `AlertPayload`) instead
    of only piggybacking on `dataUpdate`. Subscribe via
    `chart.on('alertTriggered', e => …)`. The legacy `dataUpdate` alert signal is
    still emitted for back-compat.

- 053ef97: feat: draggable price-alert lines

  - Grab an alert line on the chart and drag it to a new price — the cursor
    switches to a resize affordance on hover, and moving an alert re-arms a
    triggered one. Scale-aware (works in log / percentage / indexed modes).
  - New `AlertDragHandler` (core) wired into `InteractionManager`; hit-tested
    after trading/drawing so it only claims the gesture right on a line.
  - `AlertManager.getAlertAtPoint()` / `updateAlertPrice()` added; the chart
    emits a typed `alertUpdate` event on drag, and the alerts panel refreshes.

- a160c43: feat: mobile / touch pass

  - **Long-press tooltip pin** — press-and-hold (~500 ms with < 8px movement) on
    the chart pins an OHLC tooltip at the bar under your finger, the mobile
    equivalent of Alt+click on desktop. Cancelled by movement, by a second
    finger landing, or by `Esc`.
  - **Touch axis-drag scaling** — single-finger drag inside the price-axis
    strip (right) or time-axis strip (bottom) scales that axis exactly like
    the desktop mouse-drag gesture. No more "I can only zoom with pinch."
  - **Bottom-sheet modals** — under 640 px viewports, settings / hotkey sheet /
    command palette / symbol search slide up from the bottom with a grab handle
    and `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` padding for the iPhone home indicator.
    Hotkey sheet collapses to a single column. Sheet width is full-viewport,
    border-radius only on the top corners.
  - **Bigger touch targets** under 768 px — toolbar height 40→44 px, buttons
    pad up to 40 px square. Apple HIG-compliant.
  - **Hotkey sheet** now documents the touch gestures alongside keyboard
    shortcuts.

- bf54565: feat: price scale modes (regular / log / percentage / indexed-to-100)

  - **`chart.setScaleMode(mode)` / `getScaleMode()`** — switch the price axis
    between `regular`, `logarithmic`, `percentage`, and `indexedTo100`. Regular,
    percentage, and indexed share linear geometry; percentage labels show the %
    change from the first visible bar, indexed rebases that bar to 100. Logarithmic
    keeps the existing log geometry.
  - **Settings panel** now offers a "Price Scale" selector (replacing the Log
    Scale toggle); the legacy `logScale` flag stays mirrored for persisted
    layouts, and `setLogScale()` / `isLogScale()` keep working.
  - **`formatPriceScaleLabel()`** exported from `@tradecanvas/commons`, plus
    `PriceScaleMode` and `ViewportState.scaleMode` / `scaleBaseline`. The chart
    sets the baseline (first visible bar's close) each frame.

- 226e12c: fix: review-pass hardening of click, alert, and bracket code

  - **Spurious clicks**: resetting click-tracking state in `onMouseLeave` so a
    press that drifts out of the canvas and releases outside no longer fires a
    ghost `click` / `barClick` (and stray replay-seek).
  - **Bar mapping**: the new click handler now uses the canonical `xToBarIndex`
    (accounts for chart-rect offset and bar centering) so the clicked bar matches
    the crosshair and drawings.
  - **Bracket on touch**: touch events route to the trading manager, so the
    bracket handles (and order/position lines) are draggable on mobile.
  - **Alert level conditions**: `greaterThan` / `lessThan` are now edge-triggered
    — they fire once on entering the condition (immediate fire preserved if
    already past the level) instead of every tick; repeating alerts re-arm once
    the value leaves the level.
  - **Alert context switches**: `AlertManager.clearLastValues()` is called on
    `setData` so indicator-channel alerts don't cross against a stale previous
    value after a symbol/timeframe change.
  - **Alert persistence**: `repeating` is now saved/restored, and price-0 alerts
    (e.g. oscillator `> 0`) are no longer dropped on load.
  - **Bracket defaults**: stop distance is floored so a zero entry price can't
    collapse SL/TP onto entry.
  - **Alert sources**: multi-output indicator lines (MACD, Stochastic) are
    discovered from the latest series point so all lines are offered.

- a160c43: feat: client-side timeframe resampling

  - **`resampleOHLCV(bars, target)`** — aggregate a finer OHLCV series into any
    coarser timeframe (1m → 5m / 15m / 1h / 4h / 1D / 1W / 1M …). Open = first,
    high/low = extremes, close = last, volume = sum. Calendar-aware bucketing:
    intraday and daily frames anchor to UTC epoch boundaries, weeks to Monday
    (configurable via `weekStartsOn`), months/quarters/years to calendar
    boundaries. Input bars are never mutated.
  - **`inferTimeframeMs(bars)`** — detect the source bar spacing from the median
    gap, robust to weekend/halt gaps.
  - **`canResample(sourceMs, target)`** — guard against accidental upsampling.
  - **`timeframeBucketStart(time, tf, weekStartsOn?)`** exported from
    `@tradecanvas/commons` — the calendar-aware bucket anchor used by resampling.
  - **Widget integration** — `ChartWidget` now resamples locally when the
    timeframe buttons are clicked and no live adapter is attached: one loaded
    dataset drives every resolution, no refetch. New `widget.setData(bars)`
    registers the finest-resolution base series; opt out with
    `resampleTimeframes: false`. New `weekStartsOn` widget option.

- 8f69419: feat: timezone-aware time axis + crosshair

  - Time-axis labels, the timezone badge, and the crosshair time pill can now
    render in a fixed UTC offset instead of only the browser-local zone — handy
    for trading a market in its exchange time. `chart.setTimezoneOffset(minutes |
null)` (e.g. -300 for EST, 330 for IST, null for local), with a Timezone
    selector in the settings sheet.
  - Pure, tested `timeParts(timeMs, tzOffsetMinutes)` and `tzLabel()` helpers in
    `@tradecanvas/commons` (handles negative offsets that wrap the day and
    fractional offsets like +5:30).

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: axis-drag scaling, measure tool, symbol search + premium CSS

  - **Axis-drag scaling**: drag the price axis vertically to compress/expand the
    price scale (disables auto-scale); drag the time axis horizontally to zoom.
    Double-click the price axis to re-enable auto-scale; double-click the time
    axis to fit all data. Cursor changes to `ns-resize` / `ew-resize` over the
    respective strips.
  - **In-canvas axis polish**: price + time axes now render with subtle dividers,
    thin tick notches, and refined typography weight — drops the heavy per-label
    background rectangles for a TradingView-like feel.
  - **Widget CSS refresh**: new design tokens (typography, motion, elevation,
    shape), Inter + JetBrains Mono stacks, smooth cubic-bezier transitions,
    refined hover/active/focus states, subtle gradient toolbar/sidebar surfaces,
    larger radii on modals/command palette, animated `connected` status pulse,
    refined scrollbars, reduced-motion support.
  - New `Viewport.scalePriceRange(factor)` and `AxisDragHandler` exports for
    consumers building custom axis interactions.
  - **Measure tool**: hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and drag on the chart to draw a
    transient ruler showing bar count, time span, price Δ, and %. Exported as
    `MeasureOverlay` from `@tradecanvas/core` (lives next to the existing
    click-anchored `MeasureTool` drawing — they coexist).
  - **Symbol search modal**: clicking the toolbar symbol (or pressing
    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) opens a fuzzy-search picker over
    the configured `symbols[]`. Replaces the previous click-to-cycle behavior,
    which broke down past 3-4 symbols. New `widget.setSymbols(string[])` API
    updates the catalog at runtime.
  - **Strategy library**: four reference strategies under
    `@tradecanvas/analytics` — `smaCrossStrategy`, `rsiReversionStrategy`,
    `donchianBreakoutStrategy`, `bollingerReversionStrategy`. All return a
    `StrategyFn` ready to feed `Backtester.run()`.
  - **Hotkey sheet**: press <kbd>?</kbd> in the widget to open a categorized
    keyboard-shortcut reference (search, chart manipulation, drawing, keyboard
    navigation).
  - **Replay scrubber UI**: toolbar play button toggles a floating bottom
    scrubber bar with play/pause, step-back/step-forward, draggable progress
    scrubber, and a speed select (0.5×–100× bars/sec). Drives the existing
    `chart.replay*()` API and restores the original data series on exit.
    `ReplayManager.seekTo` now emits a synchronous `bar` event so seeking while
    paused immediately repaints the chart slice.
  - **Monte Carlo simulation** (`runMonteCarlo`): shuffles realised trade order
    N times to expose path-dependence. Returns per-step P5/P25/P50/P75/P95
    equity bands, final-equity percentiles, probability-of-profit, and
    worst-case max drawdown across the runs. Deterministic with a seed.
  - **Saved layouts**: opt-in widget option `persistLayouts: true` snapshots
    per-symbol chart type + indicators + drawings + alerts into localStorage
    and re-applies them when the user switches back. `widget.clearSavedLayout()`
    resets a saved entry. Default key prefix `tcw:layout:{symbol}`.
  - **Pinned tooltip**: Alt/Option-click the chart to anchor an OHLC tooltip
    at the hovered bar. The live crosshair tooltip then shows the price / %
    / bar-count delta to the pinned bar. Esc unpins. New `PinnedTooltip`
    export from `@tradecanvas/core`.
  - **Hover axis labels**: TradingView-style pill badges follow the crosshair
    on the right axis (current price under cursor) and the bottom axis
    (current time). Rendered with inverted theme colors + a triangular notch
    pointing at the crosshair line. Painted on the UI layer so they always
    sit on top of the static axis labels.
  - **Bar hover highlight**: a subtle translucent column behind the crosshair
    marks which bar the cursor is on — much easier to read in dense candle
    charts.
  - **Volume Profile**: optional horizontal histogram of traded volume
    bucketed by price over the visible range, with point-of-control
    highlighting. Toggleable via the new `chart.setVolumeProfileVisible()`
    API and the widget settings sheet (off by default).
  - **CSV / JSON drag-and-drop**: drop an OHLCV file onto the chart and it
    loads instantly. Parser auto-detects delimiter (`,` `;` tab `|`), header
    vs. headerless, ISO timestamps vs. unix s/ms, object-of-rows vs.
    array-of-arrays JSON, sorts ascending, and de-dups same-timestamp rows.
    Exported as `parseOHLCV` + `DragDropImporter` from `@tradecanvas/chart`.
    Enabled by default in the widget — opt out with `dragDropImport: false`.
  - **Watchlist sidebar**: opt-in right-side panel listing the widget's
    symbols with last price, % change, and a mini sparkline. Click a row to
    switch symbol. Active symbol updates from the live stream; other rows
    can be fed from your own WebSocket via `widget.setWatchlistEntry()`.
    Enable with `watchlist: true`.
  - **Day-separator dividers**: time-axis-area faint vertical lines at day
    boundaries, heavier at week/month/year boundaries with inline date
    labels. Auto-suppressed on daily-or-coarser timeframes so weekly charts
    don't paint a wall of lines.
  - **Toasts**: widget now has a `toast(msg, kind?)` helper for transient
    feedback (used by the drag-drop importer; available to apps).

## 0.8.2

## 0.8.1

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 1a9fce1: Strategy & pro charting release.

  **New package**: `@tradecanvas/analytics` (private, source-only for now) — `Backtester`, `Portfolio`, `computeRiskMetrics`, plus configurable `Commission` and `Slippage` models. Bar-by-bar execution model where strategies place orders on bar N that fill on bar N+1; emits a typed `BacktestResult` with fills, closed trades, an equity curve, and summary metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, CAGR, max drawdown, win rate, profit factor, expectancy).

  **Replay mode**: new `ReplayController` in `@tradecanvas/core` plays a historical `DataSeries` forward at controlled speed with start / pause / resume / step / seek / setSpeed. Decoupled from `Chart` so it can drive both UI replay and headless backtests.

  **Pro charting**:

  - New `equivolume` chart type (full-range boxes with width proportional to volume share, colored by close vs prior close).
  - New `fibTimeZones` drawing tool (vertical Fibonacci interval projections from a two-anchor time span).

  **API additions**:

  - `ReplayController(opts)` with `ReplayEventMap` (`bar`, `finished`, `stateChange`)
  - `EquivolumeRenderer` exported from `@tradecanvas/core`
  - `FibTimeZonesTool` exported and registered by `registerBuiltInDrawingTools`
  - `'equivolume'` added to `ChartType`; `'fibTimeZones'` added to `DrawingToolType`
  - Widget catalog (`CHART_TYPES`) lists Equivolume

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix: drawings drift after timeframe / symbol switch

  Drawings now store anchors as real timestamps instead of fragile bar indices,
  so they keep pointing at the same wall-clock time when the bar series changes
  (timeframe switch, symbol switch, etc.) — matching TradingView behavior.

  **Implementation**

  - `ViewportState` gained an optional `data?: ReadonlyArray<{ time: number }>`
    field. When set, `anchor.time` is interpreted as a real timestamp; otherwise
    it falls back to bar-index semantics for backward compatibility with custom
    callers / plugins that don't inject data.
  - New helpers in `@tradecanvas/core`: `timeToX`, `xToTime`, `resolveBarIndex`.
    Drawing base + tools use these instead of the raw `barIndexToX` / `xToBarIndex`.
  - `Chart` injects `data` into the viewport for both render and interaction
    paths (drawing creation, drag, resize, hit-test), so all flows agree on the
    same anchor format.
  - `DrawingManager.setDrawings()` auto-migrates legacy bar-index anchors to
    timestamps on load (heuristic: `time < 1e9` → bar index, upgraded via
    `data[idx].time`). Existing persisted drawings keep working.
  - `duplicateDrawing()` offsets by 3 × median bar interval (in time units)
    instead of `+3` literal — copies remain visually distinct on any timeframe.
  - `Measure` and `DateRange` tools compute the "X bars" label via resolved
    bar indices so the count reflects the active timeframe.

  **No public API breaks** — the change is additive (new optional field, new
  helpers). Custom drawing plugins that read `state.anchors[i].time` directly
  should call `resolveBarIndex(time, viewport)` to convert to a bar index.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 1333b7d: Expand indicators, chart types, trading overlay customization, and harden type safety.

  **New indicators (7)**

  - `HullMAIndicator` (overlay) — low-lag WMA-of-WMA-diff
  - `PivotPointsIndicator` (overlay) — Classic S3/S2/S1/PP/R1/R2/R3, configurable lookback
  - `AnchoredVWAPIndicator` (overlay) — VWAP that resets at a chosen `anchorTime`
  - `ZigZagIndicator` (overlay) — swing-pivot connector with deviation threshold
  - `LinearRegressionChannelIndicator` (overlay) — least-squares fit + std-dev bands
  - `AwesomeOscillatorIndicator` (panel) — momentum histogram with up/down coloring
  - `ChaikinOscillatorIndicator` (panel) — EMA(ADL, fast) − EMA(ADL, slow), exposes ADL

  **New chart type**

  - `'rangeBars'` and `toRangeBars` transform — fixed price-range bars (each bar's high − low equals a configured range)

  **Trading overlay customization (additive, no breaking changes)**

  - `TradingPosition.closedQuantity` — partial-close visualization on the position zone
  - `TradingConfig.pnlThresholds: PnLThreshold[]` — multi-stop color gradient driven by live P&L
  - `TradingConfig.positionLabel: string | (ctx) => string` — token templating (`{side}`, `{qty}`, `{openQty}`, `{closedQty}`, `{entry}`, `{price}`, `{pnl}`, `{pnlPct}`, `{pnlSign}`)

  **Web Worker indicator pipeline**

  - New `IndicatorWorkerHost` (main-thread façade) + bundled `indicator.worker.js` entry that registers all 33 built-in indicators
  - Promise-based `host.calculate(indicatorId, config, data)` offloads heavy compute off the render loop
  - Pass `null` instead of a worker for the synchronous fallback path (SSR, tests, safety net)
  - Per-request timeout, `ping()` health check, `terminate()` rejects pending requests cleanly

  **Type safety**

  - New `getNumberParam` / `getIntParam` helpers exported from `@tradecanvas/core`
  - All 25 existing indicators migrated to the helpers — invalid params (NaN, Infinity, missing keys, non-numeric strings) now fall back to documented defaults instead of silently propagating to calculations
  - `BinanceAdapter` REST and WS payloads now flow through typed `parseRestKline` / `parseWsKline` validators; `any[]` and `any` casts are gone
  - `TextAnnotationTool` text resolution moved to a pure `resolveAnnotationText` helper (no more `as string` cast)
  - `ChartStateManager.deserialize` validates the parsed shape — malformed drawings/orders/positions/indicators are filtered, missing or wrong-typed viewport fields fall back to defaults

  **Internal refactor**

  - `WidgetStyles.ts` (764 LOC of CSS-in-string) extracted into a sibling `WidgetStyles.css` file, imported via Vite's `?raw` query and inlined at build time. The TS shim is now 31 LOC; CSS is editable as CSS (syntax highlighting, linting). Public API (`injectWidgetStyles` / `removeWidgetStyles`) unchanged.
  - Chart-type dispatch (`createChartRenderer` and `getDisplayData`) extracted from `Chart.ts` into a new `ChartTypeStrategy` module with `createRendererFor`, `transformDisplayData`, and `isTransformedChartType` helpers. `Chart.ts` shrinks by ~60 LOC; adding a new chart type now means editing one focused module.
  - Removed duplicate `timeframeToMs` private method from `Chart.ts`; uses the shared helper from `@tradecanvas/commons`.

  **Test coverage**

  - 141 tests across 21 files (Vitest scaffolded in `@tradecanvas/core`)
  - New coverage for: 9 indicators, range-bar transform, trading position formatting, drawing-tool hit-test geometry, `DrawingManager` CRUD, Binance kline parsers, `ReconnectManager` backoff/cap/give-up, `TickAggregator` (tick + pre-formed-bar paths, ring buffer), `ChartState` JSON + localStorage round-trip
  - CI workflow added under `.github/workflows/test.yml` (Node 20.19, pnpm 9.15, builds commons, runs `pnpm test`)

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Broker integration API improvements — typed events, timestamp normalization, setTimeframe, DARK_TERMINAL theme.

  ## Features

  **Typed event payloads** — `chart.on('orderModify', e => e.payload.orderId)` now infers the correct payload type via `ChartEventMap`. No more runtime guards or `as any` casts.

  **Timestamp normalization** — `normalizeBar()` converts wire format `{ t, o, h, l, c, v }` to `OHLCBar`. `normalizeBarTime()` auto-detects seconds vs milliseconds (`time > 1e12`).

  **`chart.setTimeframe(tf)`** — switch timeframes on an active stream without destroy/rebuild. Internally delegates to `switchStream()` with the stored symbol.

  **`chart.appendBars(bars)`** — bulk-append for reconnect catch-up. Recalculates indicators once instead of per-bar.

  **`chart.setStatusText("LIVE · 8ms")`** — display custom status in the chart legend area.

  **`chart.setCurrentPrice(price, pulseColor?)`** — optional pulse color parameter.

  **`DARK_TERMINAL` theme** — fintech terminal palette (#0E0E0E bg, #00FF87 bull, #FF3B4D bear, monospace font).

  **`DataAdapterEventType` exported** — adapters can now `implements DataAdapter` against the real contract.

  ## Documentation

  - JSDoc on `DataAdapter` interface clarifying observer pattern
  - `OHLCBar.time` documented as milliseconds

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Locale-aware number formatting + 4 critical bug fixes + 2 performance optimizations.

  ## Features

  **Locale-aware number formatting** — new `numberLocale` option on Chart (BCP 47 format):

  ```typescript
  const chart = new Chart(el, {
    chartType: "candlestick",
    numberLocale: "de-DE", // 65.234,00 instead of 65,234.00
  });

  // Change at runtime
  chart.setNumberLocale("vi-VN");
  ```

  Affects price axis, crosshair tooltip, indicator legend, and trading overlay values. Supports any valid BCP 47 locale (`en-US`, `de-DE`, `fr-FR`, `vi-VN`, `en-IN`, `ja-JP`, etc.).

  ## Bug Fixes

  - **Keyboard shortcuts were broken** — `KeyboardHandler` was constructed then discarded, so arrow keys, +/-, Home/End, and Space did nothing. Now properly wired to `window` with focus-aware handling (ignores input/textarea/contentEditable elements).
  - **Streaming indicators froze until bar close** — Moving averages, Bollinger Bands, RSI, etc. now update in real-time on every tick instead of only at bar close.
  - **StreamManager listener leak** — Adapter listeners accumulated across connect/disconnect cycles because unsubscribers weren't tracked. Now properly cleaned up.
  - **Price formatting lacked thousand separators** — `formatPrice()` now uses `toLocaleString` for readability (`65,234.00` vs `65234.00`).

  ## Performance

  - **Cached `getBoundingClientRect`** in `InteractionManager` — was called on every mousemove event. Now invalidated only on pointerdown, resize, and scroll. Significant reduction in layout flushes during pan and crosshair movement.
  - **Replaced `structuredClone`** in drag/resize hot paths with hand-rolled shallow clone (5-10x faster for the `DrawingState` shape).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add WaterfallChart and GaugeChart — two new finance-specific chart components.

  **WaterfallChart** — Visualize running totals with positive/negative contributions. Perfect for P&L attribution, revenue bridges, and cash flow analysis.

  ```typescript
  import { WaterfallChart } from "@tradecanvas/chart";

  new WaterfallChart(container, {
    data: [
      { label: "Start", value: 10000, type: "total" },
      { label: "Gain", value: 1850 },
      { label: "Loss", value: -620 },
      { label: "End", value: 11230, type: "total" },
    ],
    showValues: true,
    crosshair: true,
  });
  ```

  **GaugeChart** — Speedometer-style gauge for KPIs, risk scores, and sentiment indicators with colored zones and smooth value animation.

  ```typescript
  import { GaugeChart } from "@tradecanvas/chart";

  const gauge = new GaugeChart(container, {
    value: 72,
    min: 0,
    max: 100,
    label: "Fear & Greed",
    zones: [
      { from: 0, to: 25, color: "#ef4444" },
      { from: 75, to: 100, color: "#10b981" },
    ],
    animate: true,
  });

  gauge.setValue(85); // smooth animation to new value
  ```

  Both charts share the performant `BaseFinanceChart` infrastructure: DPR-aware canvas, auto-resize, theme switching, and batched path operations for efficient rendering.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add 4 finance chart components (SparklineChart, DepthChart, EquityCurveChart, HeatmapChart), client-side order matching engine with trade history, and comprehensive developer documentation.

  Features:

  - SparklineChart: tiny inline line/area chart for dashboards
  - DepthChart: bid/ask order book visualization with crosshair
  - EquityCurveChart: portfolio equity with drawdown shading and benchmark
  - HeatmapChart: colored cell grid with treemap layout
  - Order matching engine: auto-fills limit/stop orders with spread and commission
  - Trade history with win rate and PnL stats
  - Toast notifications for order fills and SL/TP triggers
  - Trade-on-chart via built-in right-click context menu
  - TC prefix on all generated IDs
  - Auto-scale includes overlay indicator values
  - StackBlitz interactive sandboxes (Vanilla JS, React, Svelte, Vue)
  - Panel indicators now render immediately (no interaction needed)

  Bug fixes:

  - Stop orders show correct STOP label
  - Fix workspace:\* deps in published packages
